    "The first graph, age vs ear length, shows a wide spread of points without any strong visible trend. The dots form a dense vertical cluster, meaning that ear length varies across individuals but not systematically with age. There’s no clear upward or downward slope. People of different ages have roughly similar ear lengths. This could reflect that age isn’t a determining factor for ear size once adulthood is reached or that the dataset’s age range doesn’t capture childhood growth where such changes might occur. Overall, it suggests a very weak or no linear correlation between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second graph, ear length vs weight, shows a clearer diagonal pattern. As weight increases, ear length also tends to increase slightly. The relationship is moderately positive and more consistent than with age, meaning heavier individuals often have somewhat longer ears in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third graph, head circumference vs head height, shows the strongest and most linear relationship of all three. The points form a tight diagonal band, suggesting a strong positive correlation. As head height increases, head circumference increases almost proportionally. This is expected since both features relate to head size.\n",
    "\n",
    "These feature pairs were selected based on their highest covariance values from the table above. Each represents the most correlated relationship for its respective variable. Regarding the main question, correlations themselves are symmetric by definition. If ear length is correlated with weight, then weight is equally correlated with ear length. However, the ranking of strongest correlations is not always symmetric. While ear length’s top correlation might be with weight, weight’s top correlation might instead be with height or another size-related feature. This explains why correlation symmetry doesn’t necessarily imply mirrored feature rankings.\n"
