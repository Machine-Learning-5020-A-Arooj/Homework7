    "The first graph, age vs ear length, shows a wide spread of points without any strong visible trend. The dots form a dense vertical cluster, meaning that ear length varies across individuals but not systematically with age. There’s no clear upward or downward slope. People of different ages have roughly similar ear lengths. This could reflect that age isn’t a determining factor for ear size once adulthood is reached or that the dataset’s age range doesn’t capture childhood growth where such changes might occur. Overall, it suggests a very weak or no linear correlation between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second graph, ear length vs weight, shows a clearer diagonal pattern. As weight increases, ear length also tends to increase slightly. The relationship is moderately positive and more consistent than with age, meaning heavier individuals often have somewhat longer ears in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third graph, head circumference vs head height, shows the strongest and most linear relationship of all three. The points form a tight diagonal band, suggesting a strong positive correlation. As head height increases, head circumference increases almost proportionally. This is expected since both features relate to head size.\n",
    "\n",
    "These feature pairs were selected based on their highest covariance values from the table above. Each represents the most correlated relationship for its respective variable. Regarding the main question, correlations themselves are symmetric by definition. If ear length is correlated with weight, then weight is equally correlated with ear length. However, the ranking of strongest correlations is not always symmetric. While ear length’s top correlation might be with weight, weight’s top correlation might instead be with height or another size-related feature. This explains why correlation symmetry doesn’t necessarily imply mirrored feature rankings.\n"

    "My model performs quite well overall. The training and test results both show very similar curves, which means the regression model has successfully captured the main linear relationships in the ANSUR dataset. The predicted values follow the same general pattern as the actual head circumference values, only with a smoother line. This smoothness makes sense because linear regression fits an average trend through the data rather than trying to match every small fluctuation. The fact that the test results look almost identical to the training results also shows that the model generalizes well and isn’t overfitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I look closely at the plots, the model performs best across the middle range of head circumferences, where the majority of data points lie. However, the predictions become less accurate toward the extremes. For very small head circumferences, the model tends to overestimate and for very large ones, it slightly underestimates. This happens because there are fewer samples at the tails of the dataset and a simple linear model cannot bend to capture any non-linear relationships that might exist there. In other words, it pulls the extreme values toward the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the model, I could introduce non-linear features using polynomial terms so that it can better capture curvature at the extremes. Adding squared terms or interactions between key body measurements (like height, weight and head length) would allow the model to account for more complex relationships. \n"
